        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>For some, it is a privilege<br> 
    For others, it's a right<br> 
    The difference between darkness<br> 
    And a bright future<br>
    <br>
    Some will think a burden<br> 
    Where others see a gift<br>
    The key to moving forward<br> 
    And to give your life a lift<br>
    <br>
    If school is not your calling<br> 
    Look beyond its doors<br> 
    The world can be a teacher<br> 
    Many adventures are in store<br>
    <br>
    As long as you are learning<br> 
    Your education grows<br> 
    That will lead to contribution<br>s 
    As you share the things you know.<br>
